## Analysis of the network as a whole
```{r}
# Graph basic parameters
V(movies_actors_graph)
vcount(movies_actors_graph) # 4079 vertexes(250 movies and 3829 actors)
E(movies_actors_graph)
ecount(movies_actors_graph) # 4433 edges

# Graph degree
dg_all <- degree(movies_actors_graph) # Distribution: mostly 1(actors) and 18(because most movies got 18 actors added) 
dg_out <- degree(movies_actors_graph, mode = "out") # Distribution: almost all 1 and some 18
dg_in <- degree(movies_actors_graph, mode = "in") # 0 degree - all movies, mostly 1 and 2  
mean(degree(movies_actors_graph)) 
# Around 2.17, mostly because a lot of actors play in one movie on the list of top 250 and movies have a lot of actors

max(dg_all) # 18
V(movies_actors_graph)$name[which(dg_all == max(dg_all))] # Most movies (240/250) have 18 actors
min(dg_all) # 1
V(movies_actors_graph)$name[which(dg_all == min(dg_all))] # Most actors play in one movie

max(dg_in) # 9
V(movies_actors_graph)$name[which(dg_in == max(dg_in))] # Robert De Niro played in the greatest number of movies on the list 
min(dg_in) # 0
V(movies_actors_graph)$name[which(dg_in == min(dg_in))] # All movies are here with 0 degree

max(dg_out) # 18
V(movies_actors_graph)$name[which(dg_out == max(dg_out))] # Movies with a lot of actors
min(dg_out) # 0
V(movies_actors_graph)$name[which(dg_out == min(dg_out))] # All actors are here with 0 degree


# Graph coherence
is.connected(movies_actors_graph, mode = "strong") 
# Not connected, because there are only edges out for movies vertexes, and edges in for actots vertexes
cds1 <- components(movies_actors_graph, mode = "strong")
is.connected(movies_actors_graph, mode = "weak") 
# Not connected, because there are only edges out for movies vertexes, and edges in for actots vertexes
cds2 <- components(movies_actors_graph, mode = "weak")

plot(movies_actors_graph, vertex.color = cds1$membership, edge.arrow.width = 0.01, vertex.label = NA)
plot(movies_actors_graph, vertex.color = cds2$membership, edge.arrow.width = 0.01, vertex.label = NA)


# Graph density
edge_density(movies_actors_graph) 
# A density of this magnitude suggests very few connections between movies and actors compared to all possible connections between them.
# This is related to fact that most actors are involved in a small number of movies from the list.
# Artistic Value and Quality: The Top 250 IMDb often includes movies of high artistic quality, where cast diversity might result from careful actor selection and their acting skills, contributing to the films' overall quality.
# International Character: Movies on this list may come from various countries and cultures, leading to actor diversity associated with different nationalities, languages, and acting styles.
# Directorial Creativity: The directors of these films might actively seek actor diversity, aiming to convey different perspectives and experiences through a variety of actors in their productions.


# Graph diameter
diameter(movies_actors_graph, directed = TRUE, unconnected = !is.connected(movies_actors_graph)) 
# The diameter is 1, because there is only one edge between two vertices (from movie to actor).
diameter(movies_actors_graph, directed = FALSE, unconnected = !is.connected(movies_actors_graph))
# A result of 20 could suggest that the longest path between the most distant vertices (movie-actor-movie-actor...)consists of 20 steps 

# Graph average path length
average.path.length(movies_actors_graph, directed = TRUE, unconnected = !is.connected(movies_actors_graph))  
# This suggests that in one of the connected components of the graph, the average distance between two vertices is 1 (from movie to actor).
average.path.length(movies_actors_graph, directed = FALSE, unconnected = !is.connected(movies_actors_graph))
# Such large average distances might arise due to various factors such as diverse movies, disjointed groups of movies or actors
```

## Analysis of individual vertex parameters 
```{r}

# Graph closeness

max(cl)
V(movies_actors_graph)$name[which(cl == max(cl))]

hist(closeness(movies_actors_graph))


# Graph eigen centrality
